Proposed Artificial Intelligence geospatial pattern recognition and prediction tool (geohealthAI) provides the cost-effective cloud-based software tool for evaluating interventions and policies potentially affecting public health outcomes. Geospatial pattern recognition in environmental health data is also helpful in explaining disease patterns of relationships with social, institutional, technological and natural environment. It can be understanding the complex spatial temporal relationship between environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, air pollution and disease, and identifying exposures to environmental hazards.
